# Kernel Builder

`kernel-builder` is a Python-based tool designed to help users manage Linux kernels on their systems. It provides functionalities to list, rename, delete, and build kernels, making it a versatile tool for kernel management.

## Features

### Kernel Management

- **List Installed Kernels:**
  - Display all kernels currently installed on your system.
  - Shows kernel versions extracted from the GRUB configuration file.

- **Rename Existing Kernels:**
  - Select a kernel from the list of installed kernels.
  - Provide a new name to rename the selected kernel.
  - The tool handles renaming the kernel image files.

- **Delete Old Kernels:**
  - Select a kernel from the list to be deleted.
  - Confirm the deletion process.
  - Removes kernel image files and associated initrd files.

### Kernel Building and Installation

- **Install Prerequisite Packages:**
  - Installs necessary packages and dependencies for kernel building (e.g., `build-essential`, `libncurses-dev`, `bison`, etc.).

- **Fetch Available Kernel Versions:**
  - Retrieves a list of available kernel versions from kernel.org.

- **Choose Kernel Version:**
  - Allows you to select a specific kernel version to build from the list of available versions.

- **Download Kernel Source:**
  - Downloads the selected kernel versionâ€™s source code from kernel.org.

- **Extract Kernel Source:**
  - Extracts the downloaded kernel source archive.

- **Apply Patches (Optional):**
  - Provides an option to apply a patch file to the kernel source.
  - Supports applying patches from the current directory or a specified directory.

- **Configure Kernel:**
  - Offers options to configure the kernel:
    - Use the default configuration (`make localmodconfig`).
    - Configure from scratch (`make menuconfig`).
    - Customize from the default configuration (both `localmodconfig` and `menuconfig`).

- **Compile Kernel:**
  - Compiles the kernel using multiple cores for faster build times.

- **Install Kernel:**
  - Installs the compiled kernel and modules.

- **Update Bootloader:**
  - Updates the bootloader configuration to include the new kernel.

## Installation

### Arch Linux / AUR
